# polls2016
#### *Author: Kevin Soo*

Code for analyzing and visualizing polling and election data for the 2016 presidential election.

The repository contains the following:
* `president_general_polls_2016.csv` contains results from polls leading up to the election, taken from [FiveThirtyEight](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/)
* `clean_polls.R` cleans this data
* `clean_election2016_results` cleans the final election results from [Dave Wasserman](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133Eb4qQmOxNvtesw2hdVns073R68EZx4SfCnP4IGQf8/htmlview?sle=true#gid=19)
* `compare_polls_election.R` combines the polling data and election results

All these are used in `how-wrong-were-the-polls.Rmd` to produce a blog post. More to come!
